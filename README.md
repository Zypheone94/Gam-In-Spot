# Gam-In-Spot

Gam-In-Spot is my personal school project, it's a video game E-Commerce website, developed with React JavaScript for frontend Python Django for backend

## Launch

Clone the project with [git](https://github.com/Zypheone94/Gam-In-Spot/commits/backend) and then launch the backend server in the directory 'Back' with this commande :

```bash
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Then you can launch the frontend server in the directory 'front' with this command :

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Usage

Once Launch is done, you can acces the website, usually on this URL : http://localhost:5173
